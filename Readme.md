Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent does. In this Java implementation, the game is played in the console.

When the game starts, the 3x3 grid is displayed on the console. Player 1 is assigned the symbol "X" and Player 2 is assigned the symbol "O". The players take turns making a move by entering the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The game checks if the move is valid (i.e., the cell is not already occupied) and then updates the grid with the player's symbol.

After each move, the game checks if either player has won by checking for three in a row. If a player has won, the game ends and their victory is displayed on the console. If the game ends in a tie (i.e., all cells are occupied and no player has won), then the game ends and a tie message is displayed.

At the end of the game, the players have the option to play again or exit the game. This implementation uses Java classes and methods to organize the code and make it easy to understand and maintain.
